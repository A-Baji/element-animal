# Element Animal

DataJoint Element for storing animal meta data and genotype information. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

+ `element-animal` features a DataJoint pipeline design for subject and genotyping management. 

+ `element-animal` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of tables and dependencies. 

+ `element-animal` can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.
