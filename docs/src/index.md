# Element Animal

+ `element-animal` features a DataJoint pipeline design for subject and genotyping management. 

+ `element-animal` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of tables and dependencies. 

+ `element-animal` can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.

+ See the [Element Animal documentation](https://elements.datajoint.org/description/animal/) for the background information and development timeline.

+ For more information on the DataJoint Elements project, please visit https://elements.datajoint.org.  This work is supported by the National Institutes of Health.
